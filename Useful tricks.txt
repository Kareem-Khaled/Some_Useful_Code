- instead of using bool vis and reset it by 0 every time you can use int array
and don't reset it even one time by make vis[i]=i;
and check if(vis[i]!=i) that's mean i not vist

- swap to elements from 2 arrays to make thim equals 
sol: make frq array for one of the elemnts and check if 
frq[(sum1-sum2)/2-arr2[i]] there is exist 
	*if(sum1-sum2)is odd) we can't 


- in binary string problems (10101011100)
to generaate sequance try to make it all 1010101010
and then but all zeros after the first one
and put all ones before the firs one


- to remove on element in prefix sum array you can use:
arr[n] - (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]);

- floor ==> a/b
- ceil  ==> (a + b-1)/b
- round ==> (a + b/2)/b
